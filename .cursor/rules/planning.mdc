# Planning Phase Rules

When working on planning, specs, or product documentation:

## Specification Quality

1. **Be Specific** - Avoid vague requirements. Include concrete examples.
2. **Define Boundaries** - Explicitly state what's in/out of scope
3. **Consider Edge Cases** - Document error states and edge cases
4. **Keep It Testable** - Every requirement should be verifiable

## Structure

Use the spec template at `docs/specs/_template.md` for new features. Include:

- **Problem Statement** - What user problem are we solving?
- **Proposed Solution** - How will we solve it?
- **User Stories** - Who needs this and why?
- **Acceptance Criteria** - How do we know it's done?
- **Technical Approach** - High-level implementation plan
- **Out of Scope** - What we're explicitly NOT doing

## Sprint Management

When updating `docs/sprint.yaml`:
- Update phase as work progresses (planning → implementing → testing → done)
- Mark specs with status: pending, in-progress, done
- Keep notes about blockers or decisions

## Consistency

- Reference existing patterns from `docs/standards/`
- Ensure new specs align with product vision in `docs/product/vision.md`
- Check roadmap priorities before starting new features
