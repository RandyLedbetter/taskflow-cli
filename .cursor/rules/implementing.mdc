# Implementation Rules

When writing code:

## Before Starting

1. **Read the Spec** - Check `docs/specs/` for the feature specification
2. **Review Standards** - Check `docs/standards/coding.md` for patterns
3. **Check Sprint** - Verify this task is in `docs/sprint.yaml`

## Code Quality

### General
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Keep functions/methods focused and small
- Handle errors appropriately
- Add comments for complex logic only

### Naming
- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
- Follow language conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood

### Structure
- Organize code logically
- Keep related code together
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Extract repeated code into functions

## Implementation Steps

1. **Understand** - Make sure you understand what to build
2. **Plan** - Identify files to create/modify
3. **Implement** - Write the code in small increments
4. **Test** - Verify it works as expected
5. **Document** - Update any affected documentation

## Progress Tracking

After completing work:
- Update task status in `docs/sprint.yaml`
- Note any deviations from spec
- Flag any concerns for review

## When Stuck

If requirements are unclear:
1. Check the spec again
2. Look for similar patterns in codebase
3. Ask for clarification before assuming
