# Code Review Rules

When reviewing code or preparing for review:

## Review Checklist

### Correctness
- [ ] Does the code do what the spec requires?
- [ ] Are all acceptance criteria met?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Are errors handled appropriately?

### Quality
- [ ] Is the code readable and well-organized?
- [ ] Does it follow project standards?
- [ ] Is there appropriate test coverage?
- [ ] Are there any obvious performance issues?

### Security
- [ ] Is user input validated?
- [ ] Are credentials/secrets handled properly?
- [ ] Are there any obvious security vulnerabilities?

### Documentation
- [ ] Are complex parts documented?
- [ ] Is the spec updated if requirements changed?
- [ ] Are any new patterns documented in standards?

## Giving Feedback

### Be Constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain why, not just what
- Suggest alternatives when criticizing

### Prioritize
- **Must Fix** - Security issues, bugs, spec violations
- **Should Fix** - Code quality, maintainability
- **Nice to Have** - Style preferences, optimizations

### Be Specific
- Point to specific lines/files
- Provide examples of preferred approach
- Link to relevant standards/documentation

## Preparing for Review

Before requesting review:
1. Self-review your changes
2. Ensure tests pass
3. Update documentation
4. Write clear commit messages/PR description
5. Link to relevant spec
