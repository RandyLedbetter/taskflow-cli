# 🚀 cursor-agent-os Quickstart Guide

> Welcome to **taskflow-cli**! This guide will help you get started with spec-driven development.

## Your First 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Open in Cursor IDE

Make sure you have this project open in [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com). The AI assistant will automatically load your `.cursorrules` file.

### Step 2: Plan Your Product (Optional but Recommended)

In Cursor's chat, type:

```
/plan-product
```

The AI will interview you about:
- What problem you're solving
- Who your users are
- What features are essential

**Output:** Updates `docs/product/vision.md` and `docs/product/roadmap.md`

### Step 3: Shape Your First Feature

Ready to build something? Type:

```
/shape-spec
```

Tell the AI what you want to build. For example:
- "User authentication with email/password"
- "A dashboard that shows sales metrics"
- "REST API for managing products"

The AI will ask clarifying questions and help you think through the feature.

### Step 4: Write the Detailed Spec

Once you've shaped the idea, type:

```
/write-spec
```

This creates a detailed specification with:
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical approach

**Output:** Creates `docs/specs/[feature-name].md`

### Step 5: Break Into Tasks

Type:

```
/create-tasks
```

The AI will analyze your spec and create implementable tasks in `docs/sprint.yaml`.

### Step 6: Implement!

Pick a task and type:

```
/implement [task-id]
```

The AI will:
1. Read the spec and task details
2. Follow your coding standards
3. Implement the feature
4. Update the sprint status

## Tips for Success

### 💡 Be Specific in Specs
The more detail in your specifications, the better the AI implements. Include:
- Concrete examples
- Edge cases
- What NOT to build

### 📋 Keep Sprint Updated
After completing tasks, the AI updates `docs/sprint.yaml`. Check it with:

```bash
npx cursor-agent-os status
```

### 🔄 Iterate
Don't try to spec everything upfront. Build incrementally:
1. Spec a small feature
2. Implement it
3. Verify it works
4. Repeat

### 📚 Update Standards
When you establish new patterns, add them to `docs/standards/coding.md` so the AI follows them consistently.

## Need Help?

- Type `/help` in Cursor for command reference
- Run `npx cursor-agent-os help` for CLI options
- Check your spec at `docs/specs/` if implementation seems wrong
