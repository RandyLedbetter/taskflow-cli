# taskflow-cli - AI Development Rules

## Project Context

This project uses **cursor-agent-os** for spec-driven development. All AI assistance should follow the structured workflow defined in our prompts and specifications.

## Core Principles

1. **Spec-First Development** - Every significant feature starts with a specification in `docs/specs/`
2. **Incremental Progress** - Work in small, verifiable steps
3. **Context Awareness** - Always read relevant specs and standards before implementing
4. **Documentation Updates** - Keep docs in sync with implementation changes

## Workflow Commands

**IMPORTANT:** When the user types any of these `/commands`, you MUST:
1. Read the corresponding prompt file from the `prompts/` folder
2. Follow the instructions in that prompt file exactly
3. Execute the workflow as described

| Command | Action | Prompt File |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/help` | Read `prompts/help.md` and show available commands | `prompts/help.md` |
| `/plan-product` | Read `prompts/plan-product.md` and guide product planning | `prompts/plan-product.md` |
| `/shape-spec` | Read `prompts/shape-spec.md` and interview for feature shaping | `prompts/shape-spec.md` |
| `/write-spec` | Read `prompts/write-spec.md` and create detailed specification | `prompts/write-spec.md` |
| `/create-tasks` | Read `prompts/create-tasks.md` and break spec into tasks | `prompts/create-tasks.md` |
| `/implement [task]` | Read `prompts/implement-task.md` and implement the task | `prompts/implement-task.md` |
| `/orchestrate` | Read `prompts/orchestrate.md` and set up parallel agents | `prompts/orchestrate.md` |
| `/verify` | Read `prompts/verify-implementation.md` and verify the code | `prompts/verify-implementation.md` |

When you see a message starting with `/`, treat it as a workflow command and read the corresponding prompt file.

```

## Current Sprint

Check `docs/sprint.yaml` for:
- Current phase (planning, implementing, testing)
- Active specification being worked on
- Task status and progress

## Standards Reference

Before writing code, review:
- `docs/standards/coding.md` - Code style and patterns
- Active spec in `docs/specs/` - Feature requirements

## Contextual Rules

Additional rules are loaded based on context:
- `.cursor/rules/planning.mdc` - When working on specs/planning
- `.cursor/rules/implementing.mdc` - When writing code
- `.cursor/rules/testing.mdc` - When writing tests
- `.cursor/rules/reviewing.mdc` - When reviewing code

```json

  "standardsTemplates": [
    "coding.md"
  ]
}
```

## Important Notes

- Always verify your understanding of a task before implementing
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
- Update sprint.yaml after completing tasks
- Keep specifications up to date with implementation decisions
